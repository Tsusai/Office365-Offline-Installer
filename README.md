## Work-Office2013Installer
========================

This program uses a Microsoft Tool to create an offline (USB/DVD) install for Microsoft Office 2013 & 365 "Click-To-Run" versions (Pretty much anything sold in the US that's a digital download or retail key only package).  The Microsoft Tool requires a configuration XML.  My program creates one to the users specification and simplifies the experience.

How to use:

*Obtain the 2013 Deployment tool from Microsoft here:
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36778

*Obtain the 2016 Deployment tool from Microsoft here:
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117

*Run the 2013 tool to extract. Rename setup.exe to setup2013 and place into the setup folder

*Run the 2016 tool to extract. Rename setup.exe to setup2016 and place into the setup folder

*Using the GUI, select 2013 & Download, and click Run.  Repeat for 2016.
  Note: "Custom Install" has no effect on Download.

*Congradulations, you have an Offline Installer for Office!



Notes:
- You can rerun the download to get an updated copy.
- You can rerun the installer to add or remove programs at any time (Excel, OneDrive, etc).
