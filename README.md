Work-Office2013Installer
========================

"**** IT I'LL WRITE A BATCH FILE"  
Well I rather have something with a neat looking interface.  

What it does:  
Uses Microsoft's Click to Run Deployment Tool to install  
whatever version of Office 2013 you choose.  
Please look in Setup\setup_goes_here.txt for the link from Microsoft.  

\Office2013Setup.exe  
\Setup\Setup.exe  
\Setup\*.xml
